## üì± Demo Talking Points

"We built an AI agent swarm that replaces manual sales tasks in HubSpot"

1. **Problem:** Sales teams waste 70% of time on repetitive tasks
2. **Solution:** Shell scripts + Claude CLI + HubSpot native tasks
3. **Demo:** Watch agents process leads automatically
4. **Impact:** 95% time savings, 24/7 operation, zero infrastructure

**Remember:** Judges want to see it WORK, not perfect code!
