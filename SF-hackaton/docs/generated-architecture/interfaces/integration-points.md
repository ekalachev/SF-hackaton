## Executive Summary

The SF-hackaton system implements a distributed agent architecture with multiple integration points designed for sales automation. The primary integration hub is HubSpot CRM, which serves as both the data store and message queue for agent coordination. The system emphasizes loose coupling through standardized interfaces and file-based configuration.

### Key Integration Characteristics
- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture:** HubSpot CRM as central integration point
- **Event-Driven Coordination:** Task-based agent orchestration
- **File-Based Configuration:** JSON configuration for loose coupling
- **CLI-Based Communication:** Shell scripts with structured data exchange
- **Browser Automation:** Puppeteer for web data enrichment
