# Event-Driven Interaction Flows

This document details the event-driven architecture of the SF-hackaton AI agent system, showing how events trigger actions and cascade through the system to create automated workflows.

## Event Architecture Overview

The system operates on an event-driven model where:
- **Event Sources**: HubSpot workflows, contact activities, task completions
- **Event Processors**: Task Monitor, individual agents
- **Event Sinks**: HubSpot CRM, external systems, human notifications

## Core Event Types and Flows

### 1. Contact Lifecycle Events

## Event Processing Patterns

### 8. Event Batching and Aggregation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source as Event Sources
    participant Buffer as Event Buffer
    participant Processor as Batch Processor
    participant HS as HubSpot CRM
    participant WF as Workflow Engine

    Note over Source,WF: Event Batching for Performance Optimization

    %% Event Accumulation
    loop High-Frequency Events
        Source->>Buffer: Multiple contact_updated events
        Source->>Buffer: Multiple email_opened events
        Source->>Buffer: Multiple form_submitted events
    end
    
    %% Batch Processing Trigger
    alt Buffer Full (100 events)
        Buffer->>Processor: Trigger batch processing
        
    else Time Window Elapsed (5 minutes)
        Buffer->>Processor: Trigger time-based processing
    end
    
    %% Event Deduplication and Aggregation
    Processor->>Processor: Deduplicate similar events
    Processor->>Processor: Aggregate metrics
    Processor->>Processor: Prioritize urgent events
    
    %% Batch Update
    Processor->>HS: Bulk update contacts
    Processor->>WF: Trigger aggregated workflows
    
    Note over Source,WF: Batching reduces API calls and improves performance
```

## Event-Driven Architecture Benefits

### 9. Loose Coupling and Scalability

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer as Event Producer
    participant Bus as Event Bus
    participant Consumer1 as Data Enricher
    participant Consumer2 as Lead Qualifier
    participant Consumer3 as Outreach Agent
    participant Consumer4 as Analytics Engine

    Note over Producer,Consumer4: Decoupled Event Processing

    Producer->>Bus: Publish: contact_scored
    
    %% Multiple Consumers React Independently
    par Parallel Processing
        Bus->>Consumer1: Notify: Update enrichment priority
        Consumer1->>Consumer1: Adjust enrichment schedule
        
    and
        Bus->>Consumer2: Notify: Score threshold crossed
        Consumer2->>Consumer2: Trigger qualification workflow
        
    and
        Bus->>Consumer3: Notify: Qualified lead available
        Consumer3->>Consumer3: Generate outreach content
        
    and
        Bus->>Consumer4: Notify: Score data for analytics
        Consumer4->>Consumer4: Update lead scoring models
    end
    
    Note over Producer,Consumer4: Loose coupling enables independent scaling
```

## Key Event Architecture Characteristics

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Events enable non-blocking, parallel processing
2. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all system events and state changes
3. **Reactive Workflows**: Automatic response to system state changes
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new event consumers without changing producers
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Failed events can be replayed and reprocessed
6. **Real-time Responsiveness**: Immediate reaction to high-priority events
7. **Data Consistency**: Event-driven updates ensure synchronized state across components
8. **Monitoring and Observability**: Event logs provide comprehensive system visibility
