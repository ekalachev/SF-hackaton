## Key Workflow Patterns

1. **Event-Driven Processing**: HubSpot triggers â†’ Task creation â†’ Agent dispatch
2. **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing stages with clear handoffs
3. **Conditional Routing**: Score-based and rule-based task assignment
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation with human escalation paths
5. **Rate-Limited Processing**: Built-in delays and throttling mechanisms
6. **State Persistence**: All workflow state maintained in HubSpot CRM
7. **Async Execution**: Non-blocking agent processing with background execution
8. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe retry mechanisms for failed operations
