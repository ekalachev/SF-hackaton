# Documentation Generation - Intent-Based Prompts

## üéØ Core Intent
Generate comprehensive architectural documentation that enables developers to understand, maintain, and extend the system.

## üìã Desired Outcomes

### 1. System Understanding
**Intent**: Enable new developers to quickly grasp the system architecture  
**Output**: Clear system overview with entry points and core flows  
**Success Criteria**: Developer can navigate codebase within 30 minutes  

### 2. Domain Model Clarity
**Intent**: Communicate business concepts and their relationships  
**Output**: Visual and textual representation of domain entities  
**Success Criteria**: Non-technical stakeholders understand the model  

### 3. Technical Decision Rationale
**Intent**: Preserve architectural decisions and their context  
**Output**: Decision records with problems, solutions, and trade-offs  
**Success Criteria**: Future developers understand why choices were made  

### 4. Integration Documentation
**Intent**: Enable seamless system integration  
**Output**: API contracts, data schemas, and integration patterns  
**Success Criteria**: External systems can integrate without assistance  

### 5. Quality Assurance
**Intent**: Maintain high documentation standards  
**Output**: Metrics dashboard and quality assessments  
**Success Criteria**: Documentation stays current with code changes

## üé® Documentation Principles

### Single Responsibility
Each document has ONE primary purpose. No mixed concerns.

### Open for Extension
Templates allow adding new sections without modifying core structure.

### Interface Segregation
Readers only see documentation relevant to their role.

### Dependency Inversion
Documents depend on abstractions (interfaces) not implementations.

### Don't Repeat Yourself
Single source of truth for each concept. Use references, not copies.

### Keep It Simple
Prefer clarity over completeness. Essential information only.

### You Aren't Gonna Need It
Document what exists, not hypothetical features.

## üìê Clean Documentation Patterns

### Intent-First Structure
```markdown
## Component Name
**Intent**: What this component achieves
**Responsibilities**: Core purposes (3-5 bullets)
**Collaborators**: Components it works with
**Quality Attributes**: Performance, reliability targets
```

### Outcome-Oriented Sections
```markdown
## Desired Outcome
**Success Looks Like**: Measurable criteria
**Key Deliverables**: Concrete outputs
**Validation Method**: How to verify success
```

### Self-Documenting Naming
- Use business terms, not technical jargon
- Name reveals intent, not implementation
- Consistent vocabulary across documents

## üîÑ Emergent Design Documentation

### Start Simple
Begin with minimal viable documentation. Add detail as patterns emerge.

### Iterate Based on Feedback
Let documentation evolve based on reader needs, not assumptions.

### Refactor Regularly
Consolidate, simplify, and clarify as understanding deepens.

## üöÄ Usage

Select modules based on documentation needs:
```bash
# Generate specific module
generate_docs --module "System Overview"

# Generate with intent focus
generate_docs --intent "Enable new developer onboarding"

# Validate quality
validate_docs --check-intent --check-solid
```
