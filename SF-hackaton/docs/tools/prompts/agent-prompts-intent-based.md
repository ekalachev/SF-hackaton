# Intent-Based Agent Prompts

## üéØ Agent Design Principles

### Programming by Intent
Agents express WHAT they achieve, not HOW they do it.

### Single Responsibility
Each agent has ONE clear purpose and expertise domain.

### Clean Prompts
- Clear intent statements
- Minimal instruction sets  
- Self-documenting behaviors
- No implementation details

  - ‚úÖ "Ensure all users are processed efficiently"
```

### Success Criteria
- Code passes all tests
- Meets acceptance criteria
- Follows team standards
- Deployable to production

## üé® Clean Prompt Patterns

### Pattern: Intent Declaration
```yaml
# Bad - Implementation focused
prompt: "Use React hooks to manage state"

# Good - Intent focused
prompt: "Manage component state effectively"
```

### Pattern: Outcome Specification
```yaml
# Bad - Prescriptive steps
prompt: |
  1. Open file
  2. Add import
  3. Write function
  4. Export module

# Good - Desired outcome
prompt: "Create reusable authentication logic"
```

### Pattern: Success Criteria
```yaml
# Bad - Vague expectations
prompt: "Make it work well"

# Good - Measurable success
prompt: |
  Success when:
  - All tests pass
  - Performance <100ms
  - Zero security warnings
```

### Pattern: Interface Contract
```yaml
# Bad - Mixed concerns
prompt: "Handle everything related to users"

# Good - Clear contract
prompt: |
  Responsibility: User authentication
  Input: Credentials
  Output: Authenticated session
  Not responsible for: User profile management
```
